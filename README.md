# scratchpad.io

scratchpad.io is a standard for keeping a history of all _things_ on your phones

Apps and developers can implement scratchpad.io or use scratchpad.io's client libraries to enable scratchpad for their apps.

This is just a fantasy right now and if developers can come together, scratchpad can then be the _scratchpad_ for your things.
