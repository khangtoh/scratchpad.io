# scratchpad.io

scratchpad.io is a standard for keeping a history of all _things_ on your phones

App developers can implement scratchpad.io or simply use scratchpad.io's client libraries to enable [scratchpad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratchpad_memory) for their apps.

This is just a fantasy right now and if developers can come together, scratchpad can then be the _scratchpad_ for your things.
